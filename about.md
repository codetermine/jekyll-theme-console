# Hi there.

I made this, for me. It's a place to consolidate my thoughts and record my ideas and experiences. It's possible that someone might benefit from reading it so I made it public, though I don’t intent do promote it.\

My writings are mostly about my work, I own a small product consultancy called Codetermine. Previously I've worked for software service companies in commercial roles. That has given me an interesting line of site to the corporate mire, I get to marvel at technical and commercial 'decisions' at companies large and small.\ 

I see a lot of clever start-ups and lot of bat shit crazy ones too, so I like to write about thoughtful approaches to the product development process.\ 

Motorcyles are a passion of mine so, from time to time, I may use this site to post a motorcycle journey video or 20.\

So little of our accrued experiences are properly documented, I think it’s healthy, cathartic and meaningful to write about your life, and to articulate your ideas. You will benefit from it, even if no one else does.\ 

If you'd like to create a similar 'blog' you can fork the Jekyll repo below, as I did\
. 
The source code is found on GitHub, here: https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console \

This site has no tracking cookies. None. Nada. You're welcome. It's currently hosted via Github Pages, but I will move it to a custom URL soon. \

## What is jekyll? 

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.\

<br />Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost.\
