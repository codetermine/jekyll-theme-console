# About.

<br />I made this, for me. It's a place to consolidate my thoughts and record my ideas and experiences. It's possible that someone might benefit from reading it so I made it public, though I don’t intent do promote it.So little of our accrued experiences are properly documented, I think it’s healthy, cathartic and meaningful to write about your life, and to articulate your ideas. You will benefit from it, even if no one else does.

<br />Writings are mostly about my work. I own a small product consultancy that helps start-ups to not throw other peoples money down the drain by helping them make smarter product decission. It's a bit like running a crèche but the nappy changing is *mostly* metophorical.

<br />I see a lot of clever start-ups and lot of bat shit crazy ones too, so I like to write about thoughtful approaches to the product development process. I've previously worked for software service companies whose specialisms range from amazing deep tech (embedded linux) to much less impressive mobile apps and websites. I've always worked in a commercial role and that has given me interesting line of sight to the corporate mire; I get to marvel at technical and commercial *decisions* at companies large and small. 

<br />Motorcyles are also a passion of mine so, from time to time, I may use this site to post a motorcycle journey video or 20.

<br />Thanks for visiting. This site has no tracking cookies. None. Nada. You're welcome. 

## How did you make this thing ?

<br />If you'd like to create a similar 'blog' you can fork the Jekyll repo below, as I did. 

<br />The source code is found on GitHub, here: https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console

<br />It's currently hosted via Github Pages but I will move it to a custom URL soon.

### What is jekyll? 

<br />Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.

<br />Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost.
