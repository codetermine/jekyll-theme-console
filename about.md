# About.

<br />I made this, for me.

<br />It's a place to consolidate my thoughts and record my ideas and experiences. It's possible that someone might benefit from reading it so I made it public, though I don’t intent do promote it. So little of our accrued experiences are properly documented, I think it’s healthy, cathartic and meaningful to write about your life, and to articulate your ideas. You will benefit from it, even if no one else does.

<br />Writings are mostly about my work, my motorbike habit, and to a lesser extent some topical ramblings. I own a small product consultancy that helps start-ups to not throw other peoples money down the drain by helping them make smarter product decissions. It's a bit like running a crèche but the nappy changing is *mostly* metophorical.

<br />I meet with a lot of clever start-ups and lot of bat shit crazy ones too, so I like to write about thoughtful approaches to the product development process. I've previously worked for software service companies whose specialisms range from amazing deep tech (embedded linux) to much less impressive mobile apps and websites. I've always worked in a commercial role and that has given me interesting line of sight to the corporate mire; I get to marvel at technical and commercial *decisions* at companies large and small.

<br />Thanks for visiting. Feel free to contact me if you find anything here remotely interesting. Also note that this site has no tracking cookies. None. Nada. You're welcome.
