# ANOTHER DAY OUT | LIFE & WORK

<br/>This is just crappy site for me for me to write about my motorbike adventures. It’s *possible* that someone might enjoy it so I made it public, though I don’t intend to promote it. I may also write some stuff about my work, which is helping software start-ups to stop throwing other people's money down the drain.
