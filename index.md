# ANOTHER DAY OUT | LIFE & WORK ETC.

<br/>This is just a crappy site for me to write about my motorbike adventures. It’s *possible* that someone might enjoy it so I made it public, though I don’t intend to promote it. I might also write some stuff about my work, I'm a software product development consultant which sounds kind of interesting but actually I just spend all day trying to stop start-up founders from throwing other people's money away.  

# RECENT STUFF, MISC.
